## About ℹ️
This project aims to predict diseases using machine learning techniques integrated with a web application built using Django. The application allows users to input relevant medical information and, based on this data, predicts potential diseases or health conditions. This can serve as a preliminary diagnostic tool for users and help them make informed decisions about seeking medical advice.

## Demo 📺
Provide a link to a live demo of your project here, or alternatively, showcase screenshots or a GIF/video that demonstrates the project's functionality.

## Key Features ✨
- User-friendly web interface for entering medical data.
- Integration of machine learning models for disease prediction.
- Display of predicted diseases along with confidence scores.
- Potential for expansion with additional medical data and improved models.
